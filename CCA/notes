CCA Notes:
	Elaine Richards


Initially, I just set this up so that I could define a class and load some
information into it. 

I casually mentioned to some guys at a party that I was doing this. They
got all excited and said that if I could figure out how to read the
data files for text based games like this, I could write the game engine.

So, I did what any exciteable person would do. I sat on the floor all weekend
writing out a strategy for reading the data file, advent.dat, and loading
it into data structures.

I'm still in the process of understanding how the data is used. However, I
can set up location information and movement information so that you can
move from place to place. It's still in a fragile place, but I want it in
the repo because it does some actions I want to see and I want to know I
can go back to that state if I get discombobulated.
